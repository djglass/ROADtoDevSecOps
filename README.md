# ROADtoDevSecOps
Keynote at DevOps Days Austin 2016
Presented May 2, 2016

This lighthearted romp through security, large enterprise, and devops will have you laughing, crying, and cheering for our hero as he searches for the meaning of life. Coffee, sleep deprivation, and a lot of time on reddit helped make this Oscar(R) nominated presentation an instant family classic.

In all seriousness, this was a keynote speech so it's short on details and high on concept and humor. Hopefully the video will be posted somewhere someday. When it does I'll link to it so the world can see me struggle to get my computer set up correctly, move the mic around and create havoc for the Av guys, and go 1 minute long.
